# GeoGrid-birthday-present
Custom geo grid template you can personalize and use for your friends and family

# How to run
1. Download the code and put it in a directory
2. Download and istall VS Code for easy run
3. Open the main directory in VS Code
4. Install "Live Server" extension in VS Code
5. Right click on the index.html file and select "Run on Live Server". This will render the HTML page on a localhost. You should be able to see the grid with the prompts on the row and the column headers. Clicking on one of the tiles should give a browser prompt for putting in a password, which if entered correctly should reveal the image.

# How to customise
- The images files inside the images folder, named "Photo1" to "Photo9" represent the images that will be rendered on the grid, numbered starting from top left most panel all the way to bottom right hand corner panel. Replace these images according to your needs and rename the files accordingly.
- The script.js file has the mappings for the images to the correct answer. By default "photo1.jpg" is mapped to the password "Answer 1", and so on. You can edit the answers here by replacing the "Answer 1" with the required answer to be put in the 1st panel.

## Notes
- You might have to edit the images to fit the browser screen proper;y. Usually a square crop of 400x400 pixels works well on 100% zoom browser screen. Play around and see what fits your screen well.
